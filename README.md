Description: This workshop will provide an introduction to using GeoPackage spatial databases _without_ using specialized geographic information systems software. 

The only only software you will need is an interface to [SQLite](sqlite.org). This workshop will use [DB Browser for SQLite](sqlitebrowser.org), but any SQLite software will do. You will also need to install extensions for SQLite, which is covered in the installation instructions (see `docs/installation`).

It also presupposes *some* knowledge of SQL (structured query language), although if you don't know any it may still be of use to you.

By the end of the workshop you should have an basic understanding of:

* What a geopackage is and what it does
* How to perform basic queries
* How to perform some basic geographic operations
* How to export your data, either as a data table or in a spatial format.

Prerequisites:
 
* A basic understanding of SQL databases
* How to set environment variables in the system of your choosing (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* An interface to SQLite
