# Generic content page 

Fill these pages with workshop content. Your life will be easier if you name your file(s) in the format:

`[nav_order]_[description].md`

`nav_order` should match `nav_order` in the header of this file, and `description` is just the description.

Fill this page with any markdown or HTML that you need. You can even mix and match markdown with html!
