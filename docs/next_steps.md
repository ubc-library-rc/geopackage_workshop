## Next steps


This is obviously just a taste of what GeoPackages and Spatialite can do. Area and distance functions are just the rudiments of what's included. You may want to:
* Explore the [enormous array of functions](https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-sql-5.1.0.html){:target="_blank"}
* Import geometry (like GeoJSON files or shapefiles) and linking to other sources of data, such as demographic data, or any other data
* Join data based on *spatial* attributes
* Create database views based on queries


While this tutorial focused on using DB Browser for SQLite, you can enable SQLite extensions on *any* interface to SQLite. This is where the true power of the Spatilite extension lies. By enabling the extension in the programming language of your choice, you can:
* Create reproducible workflows
* Leverage the features of your language on the data, such as using statistical functions
* Create dashboards that query geospatial data
* Anything else your programming language supports

GeoPackages may not be simple, but they are _powerful_. By using the non-GIS approach, you can unlock many possibilities that normally would be impossible.

Use the [collected resources](resources_and_acknowledgements.html) as your guide.
